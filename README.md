silhouette-character-sheet
==========================

An automated Silhouette RPG system character sheet.

Another golden oldie and an insanity inducing attempt at taming Adobe PDF scripting, which I recommend everyone to just stay right the hell clear of.

This is for use with Silhouette Engine 2 games from Dream Pod 9, the likes of Heavy Gear, Jovian Chronicles and CORE Command. I've included the .pages file in case anyone (no one ever will) would want to make some changes of their own.
