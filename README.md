Silhouette RPG System Character Sheet

![](https://github.com/Heilemann/silhouette-character-sheet/blob/master/screenshot.png?raw=true)

Another golden oldie, and an insanity inducing attempt at taming Adobe PDF scripting, which I recommend everyone to just stay right the hell clear of. Either way, this is for use with Silhouette Engine 2 games from Dream Pod 9, the likes of Heavy Gear, Jovian Chronicles and CORE Command. All of which, as with so many RPGs, shipped with pretty crappy sheets to begin with. I've included the .pages file in case anyone (let's be honest, no one will ever want this, but nevertheless) would want to make some changes of their own.
